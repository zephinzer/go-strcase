# Code design (how it works)

## Requirements

This package was created mainly for usage within a tool that needs to handle cross-runtime naming conventions such as between `SHELL_VARIABLES` and `javascriptVars` or `python_vars`

## Tokenization

This package works by first tokenizing the input string into separate words first before applying any transformations. This looks like:

```
HelloWorld => [hello, world]
helloWorld => [hello, world]
10PizzasPlease => [10, pizzas, please]
1-for-1 => [1, for, 1]
1for1 => [1, for1]
```

## Reconciliation

After the above tokenization, the transformations are added:

```
[hello, world] =(ToCamel)=> helloWorld
[10, pizzas, please] =(ToCamel)=> 10PizzasPlease
[1, for, 1] =(ToCamel)=> 1For1
[1, for1] =(ToCamel)=> 1For1
```
